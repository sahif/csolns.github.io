						1. What does Complete Solution Pte. Ltd offer its clients that most building solution businesses in Fiji don’t? </b><br><br>
Complete Solutions is a customer focused business whose focus is on developing finished housing solutions that resolve clients’ needs and preferences. 
Thinking outside the box to develop innovative solutions. We focus on quality: on innovative, smart design; progress in social, environmental and economical sustainability and premium service that is based on achieving our aspirations of our clients and meeting end user needs. Admittedly, this may seem sound like a new building solution however this product or modular technology (containerized) offering has been around for decades. The product has evolved to meet customer’s expectations and it has been a popular and proven solution for developed and developing countries simply due to the shortage and complexities faced with conventional construction. Our point of difference is quality with price and proven technology which can be formalized and resolved upfront rather than during the build cycle. 
 
<br><br><b>2.       What is CSPL’s main objective and when was it established in Fiji?</b><br><br>
 The business was setup in 2016 to offer emergency housing solutions caused the Cyclone Winston by an experienced project management consultant/business. The business has been developed and evolved since then with its strategic local partners and suppliers aboard. CSPL’s main objective is to offer durable, reliable modular solutions across the public, residential, commercial, educational and industrial sectors. Because it has a demonstrated its capability and refined deliverables and understood what the Fijian market requires, the business embarked on raising long term awareness and at the same time bringing this solution ‘full-circle’ with that will ultimately enable buyers to make practical and smarter decisions for their future based on their budget and key requirements.  
 
<br><br><b>3.       Please highlight what type of services does CSPL offer? </b><br><br>
Our solution is a one-stop shop and designed to remove the hassle and common day to day worries and would be home owner or business are likely to face. Turn key solutions is our core capability, providing design services, assembly and commissioning. Our clients just need to turn the key and start living. We assist with the selection of key products for your build by offering options with interior/exterior cladding, flooring, windows, doors, electrical, kitchen, toilet, roofing, decking and foundations requirements. CSPL is not a construction business however promotes sustainable living through collaborative design, install and assembly approaches that removes the conventional build challenges, delivery to sites issues and potential resource constraints. Obviously, with the element of surprise minimized in return for satisfied customers, this level of comfort, security and certainty is compensated with a reasonable premium in price. 
                              
<br><br> <b>  4.    Can you elaborate further on the sustainable aspect of the business and how customers can benefit from it? </b><br><br>
Our buildings are designed to ensure that they are as energy efficient as possible. Off the grid solutions are available and innovative ways of reducing energy consumption are included in the design. Our sister company in New Zealand has just been awarded the Carbon Zero certificate which represents their commitment to the environment. 
 
 
 <br><br>  <b>5.    How does CSPL change building solutions in Fiji?</b> <br><br>
The old way of building hasn’t worked in recent years due to material and labor shortages. We are shaking up the establishment and making them think of other ways. Our build methodology is proven and very popular particularly in disaster probe areas/countries and containers. The capability to withstand winds up to 150/kms and earth quake rated, while have modern amenities, is an added bonus – something that is currently a premium in Fiji especially for middle income earners.
<br><br> <b>6.      Are these modern modular home concept cyclone prove? If you can elaborate on that please.</b><br><br>
Our designs have been reviewed by structural engineers in Fiji and New Zealand and are capable of withstanding wind speeds of approximately 150km/hr (cyclones) and is earthquake rated. In addition, we can build acoustic proofing, cladding, roofing, decking and strengthen foundations specific to your requirements.
<br><br> <b>7.      If you can briefly describe the designed offered on this home concept and its features. </b><br><br>
Starting from affordable price ranges of a basic concept to a superior, highly durable unit, a standard 2-bedroom (37sqm) consists of, a I or L shaped kitchen, toilet, bathroom and foundations, electrical fittings, footing, roofing with load capabilities of handling a roof load of 100kg, floor load of 200kg/m2, galvanised steel frame, fireproof walls, glass windows, steel or PVC doors, water connections, plumbing, exterior and interior cladding. Obviously prices will vary significantly depending on the quantities and accessories. Our solution will be ideal for either a 2-4 bedroom home (single level), an extension to an existing home (single level), a smart, safe solution for elderly parents (granny flat also rentable), a remote office / space (commercial purposes), temporary retail, training premises, remote holiday home away on the coast (weekend bach), community Halls (church activities, meetings) or commercial premises (will need to be discussed).
We can also offer project management consultancy / services as well. 
  <br><br> <b>8.    Does construction require a lot of time and effort?</b> <br><br>
Not at all. At most we estimate between 2 to 4 months provided we have all milestones satisfied within reasonable timeframes and assumptions are met. Technically, we manufacture off site and bring the completed building to site. Work onsite is kept to a minimum. This means that we can monitor and maintain high quality standards that ensure the client receives a premium product. From the time the initial deposit is paid, we will keep you updated you on progress from factory to your site. We estimate once the product reaches Fiji, we can setup the build within 2 weeks
<br><br>  <b> 9.    Is it affordable?</b> <br><br>
In a word, YES and to narrow it down further, it heavily depends on what the customer is ultimately seeking. Initially, we want to deliver in offering a quality product that compensates for the risks, issues and constraints associated with a normal build. Customers seeking a quality way of living without the hassle of engaging various contractors will enjoy the benefit of this type of modular technological approach. 
While price is important, we want to customers to feel they are also paying for better quality and shorter construction timeframes. 
Customers willing to pay this will be satisfied that this compensates for all the normal issues a conventional build would encounter and importantly would be happy to pay for a premium in return.
