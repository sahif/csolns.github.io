Complete Solutions was formed for the sole purpose of using their Innovative Modular Construction Technology in the design and build process of residential, educational and commercial facilities in Fiji.

 <br><br>

After seeing the destruction and damage caused by Cyclone Winston, the company embarked on a mid to long term plan to offer modular building solutions through the Government’s Rehabilitation Programme for Design and Build facilities in 2016 throughout Fiji.

 
<br><br>
The Modular Methodology has various advantages including speed of construction, durability, cost effectiveness, 10% bigger space than specified while remaining within the stated cost structure, less reliance on local construction material supply, transportability, cost effective quality, quality assurance and new technology

 <br><br>

Complete Solutions proposes to use a modular solution for this project and successfully deliver within four to five months once a confirmed order is made.
<br><br>
The majority of design work for this product has already been completed which will provide a significant advantage for the early commencement of construction. Materials used for internal linings are innovative, durable and functional, providing significant advantages over traditional materials used in conventional construction.

 <br><br>

The China supplier to Complete Solutions, is a leader in prefab homes and light steel construction and has the capacity and resources to deliver the modular buildings within a tight timeframe.
<br><br>
 

These will be delivered ready for assembly, with all of the building materials required packed and shipped in the containers from China. Where necessary we can engage our strategic engineering partners, to ensure structures satisfy geo-tech and building code standards. Having already undertaken many schools and building projects abroad, Complete Solutions has the know-how and refined the critical thinking pathway to deliver exactly what you’re after. We also have local Fijian construction contractors, and will undertake demolition, foundation work and the assembly of the buildings on site if necessary to ensure your home is safe and livable.

 
<br><br>
Complete Solutions and its partners visited some of damaged sites including Teidamu and Koronubu and understand the havoc these natural disasters can cause.
<br><br>
After engaging with the affected local stakeholders in different locations, we view the construction and delivery as time critical and the only solution especially for a tropical destination like Fiji.
<br><br>
Furthermore, these visits confirmed the need for a long term robust solution delivered in a cost effective framework.
<br><br>
 

Complete Solutions is confident in their proposed Modular Methodology to deliver the needed outcomes.

									Modular construction removes a number of issues that have always dogged traditional 
									construction methods including speed of construction, durability and cost effectiveness. 
									Because construction is carried out in factories, issues surrounding access for materials and availability 
									of material are removed. This is a significant advantage of our proposal over the traditional and status quo 
									methods of construction.<br><br>
									The modular process allows for the site clearance and the foundation work to be carried out at the same
									time the buildings are being constructed and delivered to site.<br This concurrent construction gets a ”head start” on 
									the structure, with walls going up as the foundation cures.<br> With these efficient schedule advantages, 
									the Modular Building Institute estimates projects will be completed 100% faster than traditional construction. <br>
									This is even more relevant, given the constraint in resources in Fiji due 
									to the high volume of impending building activity.<br><br>

									Our proposal is to use a modular building manufacturer in China.  
									This has the added benefit of ensuring that all of the materials for the construction are sourced 
									from China and the program is not reliant on local material suppliers.  <br>Given the number of schools to be 
									reconstructed and the short timeframe for the construction an alternative source for material supply is
									considered necessary.  <br>
									This solution also has the added benefit of a significant workforce that are available to
									undertake the construction immediately a tender is awarded.<br><br>

											Pre-fabricated modules can be easily transported by ship, truck or rail, because they already conform to standard shipping and trucking sizes. This is a significant advantage over prefabricated timber construction buildings. 
These typically require specialised construction to allow them to be transportable and require specialised trucking to allow them to be picked up and lowered onto sites.  In contrast, steel containers and all the accessories stacked inside the container can easily be placed on site by forklifts or hi-ab trucks. 

We do not envisage transportation problems in remote areas as the containers will be effectively be empty and the tare weight will be under 4 tonnes.  The content will be limited to the fitout materials for buildings.

										This form of construction is in effect, large empty boxes that can be configured in any manner to suit the client’s requirements. From offices to schools, residential housing to medical centres, containerised modular construction offers a low cost, fast and efficient method of constructing the envelope required to contain the activity that are required.  Package this with the ability to carry out all of the additional construction that is required in a factory away from the site and we create the ability to provide pop up facilities that affectively appear overnight.

										Complete Solutions Pte. Limited will implement strict quality assurance processes for the management of the project and in particular the construction of the buildings.  We will also implement a comprehensive risk management process for the duration of the project. 
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="tab-pane" id="five">

										As previously noted Modular construction has significant benefits of conventional construction methods. The style of construction chosen for this project has inherent benefits due to the durability of the base components and their ability to withstand the environmental challenges that the buildings will be subject to. The steel structures are treated in the same manner as normal steel buildings using zinc coatings that are designed to provide a 50 year life span against corrosion and deterioration.  The inherent strength of a structure designed to be transported around the world while protecting the materials stored inside regardless of what weather they are subjected to provides significant reassurance to the inhabitants when the buildings are subjected to the extremes for weather that occur in Fiji.  They are effectively a cocoon protecting their inhabitants against anything that nature can throw against them.


										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="tab-pane" id="six">
										<p>
										
										This method of construction benefits from the simple fact that the base structure is already constructed waiting for the builder to construct the interiors and assemble them.  This allows modular buildings to be constructed and outfitted in a manufacturing facility away for the actual building site and thus take advantage of economies of scale and in this case a willing workforce of workers in China.  It allows us to maximise and focus the efforts of the builders on site and removes bottlenecks to the construction process that are typically encountered in conventional construction projects.
This methodology allows for resources to be maximised to ensure that the build process is simplified and as rapid as it can be.  Typically, we expect to construct and deliver classrooms in half the time that a conventional approach would take.  As the volume of work increases, the time savings increase dramatically.
