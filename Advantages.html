						<h3>Advantages of Modular Construction</h3>
						<!-- parallax  -->
							<img src="img\NewBuilds\h2.JPG" 
									width="750" height="250" />
							
						<p>
						
									Modular construction removes a number of issues that have always dogged traditional 
									construction methods including speed of construction, durability and cost effectiveness. 
									Because construction is carried out in factories, issues surrounding access for materials and availability 
									of material are removed. This is a significant advantage of our proposal over the traditional and status quo 
									methods of construction.<br><br>
									The modular process allows for the site clearance and the foundation work to be carried out at the same
									time the buildings are being constructed and delivered to site.<br This concurrent construction gets a ”head start” on 
									the structure, with walls going up as the foundation cures.<br> With these efficient schedule advantages, 
									the Modular Building Institute estimates projects will be completed 100% faster than traditional construction. <br>
									This is even more relevant, given the constraint in resources in Fiji due 
									to the high volume of impending building activity.<br><br>

									Our proposal is to use a modular building manufacturer in China.  
									This has the added benefit of ensuring that all of the materials for the construction are sourced 
									from China and the program is not reliant on local material suppliers.  <br>Given the number of schools to be 
									reconstructed and the short timeframe for the construction an alternative source for material supply is
									considered necessary.  <br>
									This solution also has the added benefit of a significant workforce that are available to
									undertake the construction immediately a tender is awarded.<br><br>
						</p>
						<h3 id=Transport> Transport</h3>
						<p>
						Pre-fabricated modules can be easily transported by ship, truck or rail,
						because they already conform to standard shipping and trucking sizes. 
						This is a significant advantage over prefabricated timber construction buildings. 
						These typically require specialised construction to allow them to be transportable 
						and require specialised trucking to allow them to be picked up and lowered onto sites.  
						In contrast, steel containers and all the accessories stacked inside the container can easily be placed on 
						site by forklifts or hi-ab trucks. 

						We do not envisage transportation problems in remote areas as the containers 
						will be effectively be empty and the tare weight will be under 4 tonnes. 
						The content will be limited to the fitout materials for buildings.
						</P>
						<h3 id=Flexibility> Flexibility</h3>
						<p>
						This form of construction is in effect, 
						large empty boxes that can be configured in any manner to suit the client’s requirements.
						From offices to schools, residential housing to medical centres, containerised modular
						construction offers a low cost, fast and efficient method of constructing the envelope required 
						to contain the activity that are required.  Package this with the ability to carry out all of the 
						additional construction that is required in a factory away from the site and we create the ability to 
						provide pop up facilities that affectively appear overnight.
						</p>				
						<h3 id=Maintenance> Maintenance and Support</h3>
						<p>
						As part of the company structure in Fiji, maintenance and warrantee
						issues will be undertaken by staff located in Fiji and overseen by our Fiji based partners.
										
						</p>	
						<h3 id=Quality> Quality Assurance and Risk Management</h3>
						<p>
						Complete Solutions Pte. Limited will implement strict quality 
						assurance processes for the management of the project and in particular 
						the construction of the buildings.  We will also implement a comprehensive risk 
						management process for the duration of the project. 
														
						</p>
						<h3 id=Durability> Durability</h3>
						<p>
						As previously noted Modular construction has significant
						benefits of conventional construction methods. 
						The style of construction chosen for this project has 
						inherent benefits due to the durability of the base components 
						and their ability to withstand the environmental challenges that the buildings 
						will be subject to. The steel structures are treated in the same manner as normal 
						steel buildings using zinc coatings that are designed to provide a 50 year life span against
						corrosion and deterioration.  The inherent strength of a structure designed to be transported
						around the world while protecting the materials stored inside regardless of what 
						weather they are subjected to provides significant reassurance to the inhabitants when
						the buildings are subjected to the extremes for weather that occur in Fiji. 
						They are effectively a cocoon protecting their inhabitants against anything that nature can throw against them.
								
						</p>
						<h3 id=Speed>Speed of Construction</h3>
						<p>
						This method of construction benefits from the simple fact 
						that the base structure is already constructed waiting for the builder
						to construct the interiors and assemble them.  This allows modular buildings 
						to be constructed and outfitted in a manufacturing facility away for the actual building
						site and thus take advantage of economies of scale and in this case a willing workforce of workers in China. 
						It allows us to maximise and focus the efforts of the builders on site and removes bottlenecks to the 
						construction process that are typically encountered in conventional construction projects.
						This methodology allows for resources to be maximised to ensure that the build process is simplified 
						and as rapid as it can be.  Typically, we expect to construct and deliver classrooms in half the time that a 
						conventional approach would take.  As the volume of work increases, the time savings increase dramatically.
